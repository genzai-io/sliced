# v8worker2

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ry/v8worker2.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ry/v8worker2)

This is a minimal binding between Go (golang) and V8 JavaScript. Basic concept
is to only expose two methods to JavaScript: send and receive.

V8 Version: 6.8.275.3 (May 2018)

[A rather dated presentation on this project](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RgGVgLuP93mPZ0lqHhm7TOpxZBI3TEdAJQZzFqeleAE/edit?usp=sharing)


## Installing

Due to the complexity of building V8, this package is not buildable with `go
get`.

To install:
```
go get github.com/ry/v8worker2
cd `go env GOPATH`/src/github.com/ry/v8worker2
./build.py # Will take ~30 minutes to compile.
go test
```
If you have ccache installed, `./build.py --use_ccache` will take advantage of
it. This is useful to avoid rebuilding V8 so much.


## JavaScript API

The JavaScript interface is exposed thru a single global namespace `V8Worker2`.
The interface has just three methods `V8worker2.print()`, `V8Worker2.send()`,
and `V8Worker2.recv()`.
See
[v8worker2.d.ts](https://github.com/ry/v8worker2/blob/master/v8worker2.d.ts)
for the details.


## Golang API

Documentation is at https://godoc.org/github.com/ry/v8worker2 and
example usage is at
[worker_test.go](https://github.com/ry/v8worker2/blob/master/worker_test.go)


## Difference from the original v8worker

 * The original v8worker passed strings between Go and V8. v8worker2 instead
   communicates using ArrayBuffer, which is more efficient.

 * The original included `recvSync` and `sendSync` methods. These were
   deemed unnecessary. Now `send()` can operate both sychronously by
   returning another ArrayBuffer. Simply return a `[]byte` from the golang
   recv callback.

 * This version is compatible with modern V8, has a better build
   setup, and uses Travis for CI.

 * The original prefixed the methods with dollar signs, this version uses a
   global name space object and provides a typescript declaration file.
